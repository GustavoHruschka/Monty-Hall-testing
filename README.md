# Monty-Hall-testing

The [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) is a math/logic/probability problem based on a TV Show.
Basically, the participant is presented to 3 doors, one containing a prize, and th other 2 containing goats. 

The participant chooses one of the doors, than the host reveals one of the goats, and the participant has the option to switch the door, or to maintain the choice.

This project is a simple way to test it by force and visualize that the correct strategy is to always switch the door.
